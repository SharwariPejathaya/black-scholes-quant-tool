##  Key Features

###  Black–Scholes Option Pricing
- Analytical pricing of **European call and put options**
- Implemented from scratch (no black-box pricing libraries)
- Robust input validation for numerical stability

###  Greeks (Risk Sensitivities)
- **Delta** – sensitivity to underlying price  
- **Gamma** – convexity exposure  
- **Vega** – volatility sensitivity  

Computed analytically using closed-form expressions.

###  Sensitivity Analysis
- 2-D option price surfaces under:
  - underlying price shocks
  - volatility shocks
- Interactive **heatmap visualization**
- Designed to mirror real trader risk intuition

###  P&L Heatmaps
- Computes option **profit & loss** given a purchase price
- Highlights payoff asymmetry and nonlinear risk
- Bridges pricing → risk → trading intuition

###  Interactive UI (Streamlit)
- Real-time parameter updates
- Clean and minimal interface
- Suitable for exploratory analysis and interviews
